# 02 Other Design Considerations

Designing COAM games requires a different mindset and considerations than traditional Class 2 and Class 3 slot games

### 02.01 Demographics

- Unlike in casinos, our demographic likely veers younger and more male

### 02.02 Complexity

- These cabinets are generally more of a diversion than casino-based games. Casinos are a destination that people seek out, while gas stations are not. We need to keep in mind that features need to be straightforward

### 02.03 Upfront Information

- Most COAM games have their pay tables displayed on the screen at all times, rather than making the Player look for it in the Help screens

### 02.04 Sound

- Since these cabinets are not in casinos but in gas stations and other retail establishments, loud music and sounds are not generally welcome. We can’t assume that the sound will be turned up, let alone turned on

### 02.05 Less Than Ideal Environment

- Since COAM games are located in retail establishments as an add-on business, the environment is not as conducive to slot games as traditional casinos are. Screens can be too dim to be seen easily through the light from outside and the glare from overhead lights, the space is often cramped, and maintenance may not be a high priority for the location
