### What Defines a Skill Test

A few things to keep in mind when determining if the gameplay is properly skill-based or not:

- All Wins MUST be gated behind a Skill Test
  - **The sequence is ALWAYS: Bet → Skill → Award**
  - The Win Award may encompass an entire Bonus feature, so long as there has been a Skill Test between the Bet and the Award
  - The reel spin presentation may come before or after the Skill Test, though it is nearly always placed before the Skill Test 
- The Player has to decide something and take an action to determine success or failure
  - If there is no player interaction, it is not skill-based
- It must be possible for the test to fail
  - If there is no way to lose or fail, then it is not a skill test
- The possible award amount is predetermined as normal in a game of the type being played (usually a slot machine)
  - The skill determination only decides whether the Player receives the award or not, and it does not impact the prize amount
- These guidelines apply to all prize awards, including regular plays, bonus games, jackpots, progressives, etc.

### Features Common to All Skill Test Presentations

- Pressing the Play button without solving the Skill Test will do nothing
  - Bet Level, Max Bet, Exit, and Help buttons are also disabled until the Skill Test is completed
  - If the game is AutoPlaying, the AutoPlay will stop when a Skill Test needs to be solved
  - Some games will resume AutoPlay following the Skill Test evaluation, but it’s not required
- The potential Win Line or combination is highlighted, so it is clear to the player which potential Win is being evaluated
  - This may also involve deemphasizing symbols not involved in the potential Win
- There may be multiple Wins present; in these cases, the Skill Test is applied to the highest Win
  - Correctly solving the Skill Test awards ALL the Wins
  - Failing the Skill Test awards NONE of the Wins (this must be made clear in the Help Pages)
- Hinting at the correct answer is allowed
  - Some examples of hinting include making the correct option a different color or having it animate. Incorrect options will never be animated or otherwise highlighted
