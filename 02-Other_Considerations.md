# 02 Other Considerations

Designing COAM games requires a different mindset and considerations than traditional Class 2 and Class 3 slot games.

## 02.01 Key Differences from Casinos

- Casinos are destinations, located in and adjacent to resorts and hotels; players travel specifically to visit them and play their games. COAM games are located in gas stations and bars, often in back rooms and dark corners.
- The average COAM player—in as much as such a thing exists—is markedly different from the average casino player
  - Many are only seeking a momentary diversion, a chance to blow off a little steam and a chance to pocket a little something extra
  - They tend to be younger, working class, and are more likely to be male when compared to casino players
  - Many speak English as a second language, some do not speak it at all
- Sound is a big part of the casino experience, but in gas stations and other retail establishments, loud music and sounds are not generally welcome
  - We can’t assume that the sound will be turned up, let alone turned on
  - If there is no way to mute the sound in a game, some locations are known to simply unplug the speakers
- Because of where COAM games are located, there are specific complicating factors to take into account when designing COMA games and cabinets
  - Screens can be too dim to be seen easily through the light from outside and the glare from overhead lights
  - The space is often cramped, with low ceilings and 
  - maintenance may not be a high priority for the location
  - These locations are unlikely to have any sort of security on-premisis

## 02.02 What Attracts and Sustains COAM Players

In our hard won experience, these factors can make the difference between a success and a failure:

- **Progressives**: COAM players chase Progressives just like casino players. As a reminder, 
  - Game packs with shared Progressives should feature them prominently on the top of the game select screen, as well as in each game. 
  - Games with individual Progressives should show 
- Simplicity: 
- Entertainment Value: 
- Familiarity: 
- Fewer small wins
- Fair math
Most COAM games have their pay tables displayed on the screen at all times. Players are accustomed to being able to size up a game at a glance, and are unlikely to look in the Help screens.
