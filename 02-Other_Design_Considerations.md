# 02 Other Considerations

Designing COAM games requires a different mindset and considerations than traditional Class 2 and Class 3 slot games.

## 02.01 Key Differences from Casinos

- Casinos are destinations, located in and adjacent to resorts and hotels; players travel specifically to visit them and play their games. COAM games are located in gas stations and bars, often in back rooms and dark corners.

- The average COAM player—in as much as such a thing exists—is markedly different from the average casino player. They are seeking a momentary diversion, a chance to blow off a little steam and maybe pocket a little something extra.
- Sound

## 02.02 What Attracts COAM Players

In our hard won experience, these factors can make the difference between a success and a failure:

- **Progressives**: COAM players chase Progressives just like casino players. As a reminder, 
  - Game packs with shared Progressives should feature them prominently on the top of the game select screen, as well as in each game. 
  - Games with individual Progressives should show 
- Simplicity
- Entertainment Value
- Familiarity

## 02.01 Demographics

- Unlike in casinos, our demographic likely veers younger and more male

## 02.02 Complexity

- These cabinets are generally more of a diversion than casino-based games. Casinos are a destination that people seek out, while gas stations are not. We need to keep in mind that features need to be straightforward

## 02.03 Upfront Information

- Most COAM games have their pay tables displayed on the screen at all times. Players are accustomed to being able to size up a game at a glance, and are unlikely to look in the Help screens.

## 02.04 Sound

- Since these cabinets are not in casinos but in gas stations and other retail establishments, loud music and sounds are not generally welcome. We can’t assume that the sound will be turned up, let alone turned on

## 02.05 Less Than Ideal Environment

- Since COAM games are located in retail establishments as an add-on business, the environment is not as conducive to slot games as traditional casinos are. Screens can be too dim to be seen easily through the light from outside and the glare from overhead lights, the space is often cramped, and maintenance may not be a high priority for the location
