# 03 Market Considerations

Designing COAM games requires a different mindset and considerations than traditional Class 2 and Class 3 slot games.

## 03.01 Key Differences from Casinos

- Casinos are destinations, located in and adjacent to resorts, fine dining, and hotels; players travel specifically to visit them and play their games. COAM games are located in gas stations and restaurants, often in back rooms and dark corners
- The average COAM player—inasmuch as such a thing exists—is markedly different from the average casino player:
  - Many are only seeking a momentary diversion, a chance to blow off a little steam, and a chance to pocket a little something extra; many do not specifically set out to play
  - Anecdotally, they tend to be younger, are largely working class, and are more likely to be male than casino players. As such, the themes that work in casinos do not always work in COAM
  - Many speak English as a second language; some do not speak English at all. Aim for designs that are understandable without needing to read anything
- Sound is a big part of the casino experience, but in gas stations and other retail establishments, constant loud music and sounds are not generally welcome
  - We can't assume that the sound will be turned on. All critical feedback and directions must be visible on-screen; never rely on sound alone
  - Make sure you can mute the sound in your game. If you cannot, many locations will simply unplug the speakers
- Because of where COAM games are located, there are specific complicating factors to take into account when designing COAM games and cabinets
  - Screens can be difficult to see through glare from overhead lights and outside light, depending on how the location is set up. Avoid small text, subtle color changes, and small designs for anything of importance
  - Maintenance of the machines is the responsibility of the MLH, who may not be immediately available if a problem arises. Design games and hardware to recover gracefully from most errors. Anything not resolved by power cycling the Cabinet is likely to leave it out of order for a time
  - These locations are unlikely to have any on-premises security to prevent damage or attempts to break into the Cabinet. Once again, building robust hardware is important
  - The space is often limited, with low ceilings and cramped seating. There is not much to be done about this except to make games that players will keep playing regardless of any discomfort

## 03.02 What Attracts and Retains COAM Players

In our experience and observation, these factors can make the difference between success and failure. Note that these are generalities and prone to change over time and even from location to location.

- **Progressive Jackpots**: COAM players chase Progressives just like casino players. Games that prominently display Progressives tend to outperform those that do not
  - Game packs with shared Progressives should feature them prominently on the game select screen
  - Games with individual Progressives should show them on the game select screen as well so players will know which games have Progressives
  - Persistent and Metamorphic features can create a similar anticipatory feeling as well
- **"Fair" math**: Since they tend to play more often and for shorter periods of time compared to casino players, finding the right math for COAM players can be a challenge.
  - Avoid wins that pay back less than your bet; players report they can be frustrating, feeling like a waste of time and effort
  - Too many *small* wins can become grating—recall that the Skill Test isn't a feature, it’s a chore. Players can become bored or annoyed with a Skill Test that comes up too often for little gain
  - Too *few* wins can be a problem, even if the eventual wins are big. Not all players are patient; many will walk away from a game that feels as though it is only taking from them
- **Simplicity**: COAM games, especially their Skill Tests, need to be quick and easy to grasp. For example, most COAM games also have their pay tables displayed on the screen at all times. Players are accustomed to being able to size up a game at a glance without resorting to the Help pages
- **Familiarity & Innovation**: Many COAM players can be reluctant to try games with unfamiliar Skill Tests. At the same time, some players do seek out the new and different. The safest approach to attracting the most players is to mix the innovative and the tried-and-true in each Game Pack
